## 💡 Why It Matters

Mental health support is underutilized in tech. By understanding user profiles and behavioral trends, we can design AI-based solutions that:
- Offer low-friction early screening
- Recommend relevant resources
- Support anonymous conversations before clinical intervention

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Incorporate the 2016 updated dataset
- Build predictive models (logistic regression, decision trees)
- Prototype an AI-based chatbot support tool (e.g., using LLMs)
